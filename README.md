  <h1>eyes-sourcemap-vite</h1> <p>A Vite plugin for uploading source maps during build processes, supporting error tracking and debugging in production.</p>
</div>

üìã Introduction

eyes-sourcemap-vite is a powerful Vite plugin that automatically uploads source maps at build time, enabling efficient debugging and error tracking. It executes after the build process, before the final output of the dist folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

Source maps must be enabled in your Vite build, or the plugin won't function.
You need to provide a server-side API to receive uploaded source maps.
This plugin is specifically designed for Vite projects.



üöÄ Installation

Install the plugin via npm:

```bash
npm install eyes-sourcemap-vite --save-dev
```

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Below is an example of how to configure the plugin in your vite.config.js:

```bash
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import EyesSourceMap from 'eyes-sourcemap-vite';

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  plugins: [
    EyesSourceMap({
      dsn: 'http://your-upload-url', // Required: API base URL for uploads
      token: 'your-project-token',   // Required: Unique project identifier
      uploadScript: ['vue-cli-service build --mode staging'], // Optional: Commands triggering upload
      productionSourceMap: true,     // Optional: Retain source maps (default: false)
      concurrency: 6,                 // Optional: Max upload concurrency (default: 5)
      api: '/api/upload/sourcemap'   // Optional: API endpoint for uploads (default: /api/upload/sourcemap)
    })
  ],
  build: {
    sourcemap: 'hidden', // Ensure sourcemaps are generated
  }
}));

```
